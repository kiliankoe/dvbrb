This is an unofficial gem giving you a few options to query Dresden's public transport system for current bus- and tramstop data.

Similar libs also exist for [Node](https://github.com/kiliankoe/dvbjs), [Python](https://github.com/kiliankoe/dvbpy) and [Swift](https://github.com/kiliankoe/DVB) ðŸ˜Š

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dvb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dvb
## Usage

```ruby
require 'dvb'

# Calling the following will return a list of DVB::Departure objects
# encapsulating information about upcoming departures at the given stop. 
# I've also gone ahead and filtered out departures that do not have "3" 
# as their line identifier.

deps = DVB::monitor('albertplatz').select { |d| d.line == '3' }
puts deps
# 3 CoschÃ¼tz @ 2016-08-29 17:57:58 +0200
# 3 Wilder Mann @ 2016-08-29 18:03:58 +0200
# 3 CoschÃ¼tz @ 2016-08-29 18:07:58 +0200
# ...

# The second optional parameter sets a time offset into the future, 
# default is 0. The third optional parameter limits the amount of results, 
# default is as many as possible.

deps = DVB::monitor('albertplatz', 10, 2)
puts deps

## Why?

At this point I consider writing wrappers for the DVB/VVO APIs as somewhat of an extensive hello-world exercise for myself. I'm trying to get back into Ruby and realized I've never published a gem, so here goes nothingÂ ðŸ˜„
