This is an unofficial gem giving you a few options to query Dresden's public transport system for current bus- and tramstop data.

Similar libs also exist for [Node](https://github.com/kiliankoe/dvbjs), [Python](https://github.com/kiliankoe/dvbpy) and [Swift](https://github.com/kiliankoe/DVB) ðŸ˜Š

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dvb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dvb
## Usage

Calling the following will return a list of `DVB::Departure` objects encapsulating information about upcoming departures at the given stop.

```ruby
DVB::monitor('helmholtzstrasse')
```
